  <h1>Journal</h1>
  <p>March 9th, 2020 </br> Day one of Boise CodeWorks included introductions of the staff and student. Along side a brief overview of the fullstack immersive course. I'm excited to see where this journey with Boise CodeWorks will lead. I've already learned a few new techniques including how to push/commit to Github from the commandline and VScode UI. </p>
