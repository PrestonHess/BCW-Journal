  <h1>Journal</h1>
  <p>March 9th, 2020 </br> Day one of Boise CodeWorks included introductions of the staff and student. Along side a brief overview of the fullstack immersive course. I'm excited to see where this journey with Boise CodeWorks will lead. I've already learned a few new techniques including how to push/commit to Github from the command line and VScode UI. I do challenge with some foundamentals of HTML and CSS. However, I plan to rememdy that with extra hours of study time after class.</p>
